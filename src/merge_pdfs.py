"""
Converts a zip file containing *ONLY* PDF files and merges them into a single PDF. The files are merged in alphabetical
order. Thus, one way to ensure the correct order is to prepend index numbers to the filenames within the zip.

NOTE TO SELF:
    To compile a new version, run `pyinstaller merge_pdfs.py --clean --onefile` from the terminal within pycharm
